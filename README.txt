All of these files eventually generated solutions to the proposed problems,
however a lot of them are very badly written and i was able to fix some of them quickly after improving at coding (e.g.: Day 7).

Even though I am not proud of a lot of these solutions, I will no longer edit any of them and instead participate in Advent of Code 2023 when it comes out, and compare my style and quality to 2022.

Strongest Solutions imo:
Day 5
Day 7
Day 17
Day 19
